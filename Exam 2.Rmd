## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r set, include = FALSE}
# clear working environment
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))

#set working directory
getwd
setwd("C:/Users/choy9/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Summer20/Data Science/Exam 2")

#load inequality dataset into R and save as 'inequality_data'
inequality_data <- read.csv("inequality.csv")
```

### Cross-Sectional vs. Panel
This data is cross-sectional.  It examines the inequality in several countries all in the same year.

```{r data proof, include=TRUE}
# checking to see if each country variable is unique
if (length(unique(inequality_data$country)) == nrow(inequality_data)) {
  print("There are no repeated countries")
}

# checking to see if each year variable is "2015"
if(inequality_data$year == "2015") {
  print("All data is from 2015")
}
```
The inequality Gini scores for Denmark and Sweden:
```{r gini, include=TRUE}
# subsetting the inequality_gini scores for Denmark and Sweden
inequality_data_gini<- inequality_data$inequality_gini
inequality_data_sub <- subset(inequality_data_gini, inequality_data$country == "Denmark"|inequality_data$country == "Sweden")

#printing the scores
inequality_data_sub
```
The inequality Gini score for Brazil is:
```{r gini2, include = TRUE}
#subsetting Brazil's inequality Gini score
Brazil_Gini <- subset(inequality_data_gini, inequality_data$country == "Brazil")

#printing score
Brazil_Gini
```
It's much better to have a low inequality Gini score, because it means that there is less economic inequality in the country.

```{r head, include = TRUE}
# looking at data
head(inequality_data)

#creating accent.remove function
accent.remove <- function(x){
old1 <- "Ãº"
new1 <- "u"
x1 <- chartr(old1, new1, x)
  }
inequality_data = accent.remove(inequality_data$country)
head(inequality_data)
```
Data sorted from least inequality to most:
```{r sort, include=TRUE}
inequality_data_sorted <- inequality_data[order(inequality_data$inequality_gini),]
head(inequality_data_sorted)
```
The mean inequality Gini score:
```{r mean, include = TRUE}
mean(inequality_data$inequality_gini, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r, include = TRUE}

high_inequality <- ifelse(inequality_data$inequality_gini > 36.81, 1, 0)
low_inequality <- ifelse(inequality_data$inequality_gini < 36.81, 1,0)
